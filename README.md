# SARS-COV-2 RNA editing
<b>A-to-I RNA editing in SARS-COV-2</b>

<p>RNA editing by adenosine deamination is a key molecular mechanism to modulate the innate immune response. During the course of a viral infection, it can have antiviral effects by destabilizing double stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) or proviral effects by suppressing the immune response.<br>
Here we provide the computational workflow to detect A-to-I RNA editing in the SARS-COV-2 genome. Our scripts enable the identification of hyper-edited reads as well as A-to-I editing at single nucleotide resolution.</p>
